*Andres Cabrera, of CsoundQT fame, has announced a new OSC application for creating and using OSC performance interfaces on the go with Android.  His original email to the Csound mailing list is below:*


I've finally put together an Android release of my OSC app for Android. You can find it here:

More info here:

And sources here:

Who wants to have a go at building it for iphone (it should work out of the box...)? :)

AFAIK this is the only OSC application that lets you edit the OSC interfaces directly on the phone. Although it still has some rough edges it's now usable. Let me know what you think.

Cheers,
Andr√©s
