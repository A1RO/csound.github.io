All sounds have been generated using solely the "pluck"-opcode, which simulates the sound of a plucked string.

<font color="#333333">A mix created from fragments created in AVSynthesis. The sounds are all made with Csound-based instruments designed by Jean-Pierre Lemoine. Four primary synthesis methods are used - a matrix modulation synth, an analog design, an implementation of the VOSIM synthesis method, and an implementation of the CHANT synthesizer. The mix was made with Mixbus on a Linux system, remixed with Bitwig for Linux.

			<p class="western"><font color="#333333">Dave Phillips is a composer/performer/educator living in Ohio USA. His studies include classical guitar with Sophocles Papas (Washington DC) and music composition with Michael Jon Fink (Los Angeles CA). He has been an active user of Csound since 1989. Since the mid-90s he has focused on using Linux as a music and sound production platform, working with developers to improve and expand the audio software available for Linux users. Dave is the author of one book and hundreds of articles, all about Linux music and sound software. He has also contributed to various other documentation projects, again all related to Linux audio topics. His electroacoustic compositions have been played in concerts and festivals at Bowling Green State University, Virginia Tech, and CCRMA at Stanford University, and he continues to perform as a solo guitarist/singer and in various local groups.
