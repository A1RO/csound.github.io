<font color="#333333">Looking
			back at more than 30 years of working side-by-side with Professor
			Barry Vercoe at The MIT Media Lab and on MIT Csound, Berklee
			College of Music’s Professor of Electronic Production and
			Design, Dr. Richard Boulanger, author and editor of The Csound
			Book (MIT Press - 2000), will share his personal stories on
			Csound’s roots (1969-1985); birth (1986); the early years
			(1986-1991); and hi-light some seminal projects and breakthroughs
			along the way (ADI SharCsound, OLPCsound, MIDI, Real-Time Audio
			IO, GPL Open Source Licensing, and Csound5). In this talk, Dr.B.
			will share his wonderful collaborative and mentoring experiences
			with Barry Vercoe, dating back to the pre-dawn of the program
			through the early years of this amazing three decade Csound saga.
			What were some of the fun, funny, and amazing Csound-based
			projects upon which Richard and Barry collaborated? What led to
			Csound? Where did it come from? What were some of the early
			hurdles and breakthroughs? Who were the key developers along the
			way, and in what ways did they help to carry the torch and blaze a
			new path?</font></p>
			<p class="western"><font color="#333333">For me, music is a medium
			through which the inner spiritual essence of all things is
			revealed and shared. Compositionally, I am interested in extending
			the voice of the traditional performer through technological means
			to produce a music that connects with the past, lives in the
			present and speaks to the future. Educationally, I am interested
			in helping students see technology as the most powerful instrument
			for the exploration, discovery, and realization of their essential
			musical nature—their inner voice.</font></p>

			is an iOS vocal processing App(lication) built with Csound. The

			harmonisation and common time domain processes. Background and
			motivation will be discussed, followed by an overview and
			demonstration of the App. Reflections on the development process
			will be offered, from critical listening and referencing to
			algorithm emulation and development, testing and release. The
			primarily 'trial and error' approach taken to the process will be
			highlighted throughout.</font></p>

			the world and published in a number of books and journals. He also
			works professionally as a musician, producer and audio programmer.</font></p>

			impacts upon Csound use and practice. I will also look at how
			these developments influenced my own approach to designing Blue
