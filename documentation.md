`TODO: This page should describe how to get started with Csound, probably there should be simple tutorials, etc.`

The [Csound FLOSS Manual](http://www.flossmanuals.net/csound/index/) is an online textbook for understanding and using Csound.

The official [Csound Reference Manual](docs/manual/index.html) is online as well as included in the frontends. It contains all information about the usage of the 1500+ opcodes and much more.
