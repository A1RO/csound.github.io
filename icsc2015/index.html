                      <p>Patching environments presented in software such as Pure Data, AudioMulch and Max/MSP seem to attract a far higher percentage of computer music novices than traditional text based compilers. So how would Csound fare if presented in such an environment? The latest version of Cabbage attempts to find out. Cabbage Studio is a new Csound based DAW that provides users with a fully functional patching interface and development environment. Users can edit the audio graph on the fly where each node in the graph can be either a Csound instrument, or a 3rd party audio plugin.</p>

                    <div class="toggle-item-body" style="display: none;">
                      <p>Computer Music is a field that is now almost sexagenarian. Since the early days of Max Mathews Bell Labs experiments, it has evolved a symbiotic relationship between the artistic and the scientific. In a way, it is the former that gives meaning to the latter, and the latter that allows the former to move forward. Because of this, composers who want to engage solidly with the field need to come to terms with both aspects of Computer Music. For this, there is an emerging set of skills and craft that is becoming the basis for his or her education. These are very different to the ones normally gained in a traditional `conservatory’ musical training, although the two are not mutually-exclusive and can coexist very well. In some places, a very common practice has been of composers employing technicians to create the electronic or computer parts for their music. Although, as a creative-collaborative effort, this might have its merits, it is often the case that the motivation has more to do with the lack of skills from the `composer’, than a inherent desire in the cooperative endeavour. This mode of operation is very dated, and we have every right to expect that a computer musician will have to learn the tools of his/her trade. Thus, it is high time we face to the task of developing in well-defined way what a Gradus ad Parnassum for Computer Music could be, and how Csound can contribute to it.</p>

                      <p>The “Csound On Stage Musical Operator” (COSMO) project brings the sound processing language Csound to a portable, standalone musical device in a stomp box guitar pedal format. This pedal is designed for live performances on stage and allows an easy integration of customized Csound based effects into an existing live-electronic setup (Ervik et al., 2013). Inside the COSMO box, a Raspberry Pi micro-computer is running Csound 6.0 (Csound Python API) with a custom designed pre-assembled circuit board (Hardware Attached on Top, C-HAT), which is mounted to the Raspberry Pi GPIO socket. C-HAT allows to connect up to eight free assignable foot-switches, knobs and LEDs from the front panel of pedal to the Raspberry Pi. Though, the COSMO pedal is originally designed along the lines of a classic guitar effect pedal, the C-HAT allows to connect any type of analog control inputs (sensors, expression pedals etc.), as well as an array of LEDs. The C-HAT furthermore, supports a MIDI-In and MIDI-Out connection, which makes the COSMO device more flexible for applications like a standalone Csound based synthesizer or for interactive sound installations. A concept for a beginner workshop has been developed which foresees to build the COSMO device and explains the basics of Csound effect programming to the participants in a two-day schedule. Being able to provide the pre assembled C-HAT board reduced the amount of soldering in a workshop by one day. This presentation will give an overview about the COSMO project and will outline the workshop concept.</p>

                      <p>Auditory displays present information through sound. As part of an auditory display, the process of rendering information and interaction as sound is called sonification. Sonification can take many forms and be applied to many different problems: from understanding radiation through the clicks from a Geiger counter to developing the complex sound language presenting information in some computer games today. The study of sonification is very developed and a scientific community with expertise in sound synthesis, big data, user interaction, computer science and cognition (among others!) has gathered together around it.</p>

The piece played at Csound Conference 2013 is based on the data sent from audience by using their own smartphones or tablets without having to install any dedicated app. The system uses a WiFi router for accepting connection from each participant, and a Linux laptop that runs Csound and lighttpd. By performing XMLHttpRequest data transmissions from the smartphone browsers, OSC message is generated by a PHP script to control Csound. The revised system that includes processing by HTML5 Web Audio API and Websocket that were added to enhance feedback to each participant is also described.</p>

                      <p>This paper describes [self.], an open source art installation that embodies artificial intelligence (AI) in order to learn, react, and respond to stimuli from its immediate environment. Biologically inspired models are implemented to achieve this behavior, and Csound is used for most parts of the audio processing involved in the system. The artificial intelligence is physically represented by a robot head, built on a modified moving head for stage lighting. Everything but the motors of the stage lighting unit was removed and a projector, camera and microphones added. No form of knowledge or grammar have been implemented in the AI, the system starts in a ‘tabula rasa’ state and learns everything via its own sensory channels, forming categories in a bottom-up fashion. The robot recognizes sounds and faces, and is able to recognize similar sounds, link them with the corresponding faces, and use the knowledge of past experiences to form new sentences. Since the utterances of the AI is solely based on audio and video items it has learned from the interaction with people, an insight into the learning process (i.e. what it has learned from who) can be glimpsed. This collage-like composition has guided several design choices regarding the aesthetics of the audio and video output. This paper will focus on the audio processes of the system, herein audio recording, segmentation, analysis, processing and playback.</p>

                      <p>The main idea behind Knuth and Alma  is the development of a simple live-electronic setup for a speaker. It follows the german child song "Ich geh mit meiner Laterne", which describes a couple of a child and a lantern. For the speaker, their lantern is a small loudspeaker; small enough to be carried and to be put on the table, beneath the speaker when they read a text, large enough to be a counterpart to the human voice. Although the setup is the same for both, Knuth and Alma focus on quite different aspects of spoken language, and output quite different sounds. Knuth analyzes the rhythm of the language and triggers pre-recorded samples of any sound, whereas Alma recalls parts of the speaker's past and does not use any other sound except the speaker's live input itself. Author will first describe the two models and their implementation in Csound, then he will discuss some use cases and future possibilities.</p>

                      <p>MaxMSP is a popular audio programming environment that enables the quick prototyping of complex graphical interfaces which may be distributed as standalone applications for OS X and Windows. It is possible to exchange audio/control signals and table-based functions between MaxMSP and the Csound engine, thus taking full advantage of Csound’s DSP and Max’s GUI. This paper discusses the idiosyncrasies of the intercommunication between Csound and MaxMSP, and presents an application for multichannel granular and spectral sound transformation.</p>

                      <p>Adaptive audio for games presents a serious challenge for both developers and sound designers. Existing audio middleware offer some solutions, but fall way short of the kind of tools sound designers are used to working with. As games consoles become more and more powerful it is time for developers to embrace more powerful audio engines. CsoundUnity is a fully integrated audio middleware for the Unity(3D) game engine. It extends previous work on the development of a C# wrapper to the Csound API, by creating a Unity specific C# library that embeds Csound directly into Unity games. With CsoundUnity users have at their fingertips one of the most powerful synthesis systems in existence. Exiting audio middleware force users to work outside of Unity in some kind of hybrid graphical environment. CsoundUnity lets user’s script directly in Unity without needing to constantly move between environments.</p>

                      <p>ChuckSound is a plugin for ChucK (otherwise known as a “chugin”) that allows Csound to be run inside of ChucK. Prior to ChuckSound, a typical setup for getting Csound + Chuck working together would be to start ChucK and Csound as separate applications, and to use OSC and/or JACK to communicate. With ChuckSound, Csound is spawned inside of ChucK’s audio engine via the Csound API. This approach allows Csound to work seamlessly with ChucK objects without any sort of latency that OSC would produce. ChuckSound has the ability to evaluate Csound orchestra code inside of ChucK as well as send score events.</p>

At its present state, Csound provides the efficient environment for agile sound experimentation, allowing to deal with almost any known sound synthesis and processing method via the vast collection of ready-made opcodes. But despite this fact, the Csound community still lacks for quality reproductions of well-known synthesizers, with commercial-grade UI and possibilities, which in compiled form could have been used without knowledge of Csound. To fill this gap, the authors implemented two commercial-style synthesizers, one of which has been additionally augmented with the semantic synthesis control knobs. The paper describes their architecture, Csound specific aspects of full-featured synthesizer development and a simple solution for “semantization” of the synthesizer's control space.</p>

                      <p>This project aims to harness WebSockets to build networkable interfaces and systems using Csound’s Portable Native Client binary (PNaCl) and Socket.io. There are two methods explored in this paper. The first method is to create an interface to Csound PNaCl on devices that are incapable of running the Native Client binary. For example, running Csound PNaCl on a desktop and controlling it with a smartphone or a tablet. The second method is to create an interactive music environment that allows users to run Csound PNaCl on their computers and use musical instruments in an orchestra interactively. In this paper, we will also address some of the practical problems that exist with a modern interactive performance system - latency, local versus global and everyone controlling every instrument versus one person per instrument. The result of this paper culminates in a performance system that is robust and relies on web technologies to facilitate musical collaboration between people in different parts of the world.</p>

                      <p>Csound is a powerful synthesis environment, that has been traditionally exclusive from a modern DAW setup. While it is possible to route MIDI to Csound, and audio from Csound, there has never been a solution that has fully integrated Csound into a DAW environment. Over the course of this paper, we will discuss how users can use Csound for Live to create Max for Live Devices for their instruments that allow for quick editing via a GUI, allow for tempo and transport synced operations and automation, as well as the ability to control and receive information from Ableton with Ableton’s API, and preset saving and recalling. Users will learn best practices for designing instruments that leverage both Max and Live, and will see demonstrations of instruments used in a full song, as well as how to integrate the powerful features of Max and Live into a production workflow.</p>

Since being a Csound user, he experimented with on-the-fly evaluation starting from Csoung 6.0. With few public performances in Reykjavik with pure Csound, he left the Csound languge in live-coding for Clojure, a LISP running on the JVM. The power of Clojure language is very suited for live-coding and Hloðver will talk about how Clojure can be used to communicate with Csound, ending with a short performance.</p>

                      <p>Csound is a very powerful audio engine, but by syntactic ease of use it is still far behind the modern languages like Python, Ruby or Haskell. That is sad because clumsy syntax prevents many users from unlocking the real powers of Csound. In my library csound-expresion I'd like to take the best parts of Csound (powerful audio engine and scheduler) and supply them with the wings of syntax gifted to Haskell. The proposed solution can greatly enhance the productivity of the Csound musician.</p>

                      <p>Rún na Mara uses as its source, recordings made on a sailing trip from Ireland through the Western Isles of Scotland on a boat of the same name. Many of the recordings were made through contact microphones attached to the boat's hull or sheets (rigging). Adopting this approach we start to imagine the boat as an organism of sound as we pass our 'stethoscopes' over the surface of its body.</p>
                      
                      <p>Ways in which a sailing boat mimics a musical instrument were not overlooked either, with its tensioned materials of rope and cloth, pulling across a rigid hollow body. 'Played' by the wind and sea, the paradigm employed in physical modeling sound synthesis of excitation signal and resonator is reflected.</p>
                      
                      <p>My primary tool in the manipulation and development of these sounds was Csound. I was keen to enhance the gestural aspect of these sounds so much of their processing was carried out in real-time with parameter modulation implemented through the use of a range of sensors. Musically the piece attempts to draw out elements of coherence and pattern within the sources, sometimes imitating or commenting upon them through the addition of purely synthesized components.</p>

                      <p>Concrete is a building material, a kind of unshaped dry powder made of sand, granulated stones and cement, dusty and chaotic. Mixed with water it becomes flexible and fluid and goes into a metamorphosis to become dry again, static and resistible and of any wanted shape. Aspects of working with native granularity, fluidness as well as stiffness and different kind of acoustic spaces were leading ideas of the composition.
                      How does concrete sounds like?</p>

                      <p>To produce the sound of congealed concrete, different objects were moved on the floor (glass, metal, paper, plastics, stone, wood) like a macro−scan−pickup of a turntable. Contact microphones were mounted to the objects in order to record the resonant movements of the objects on the floor. "Topos Concrete" is based upon the resulting sounds which exhibit rich spectra and numerous individual sound gestures and textures.</p>

                      <p>"Topos Concrete" isn't about telling an ongoing "story" about concrete but about the sounding and musical quality of concrete as a substance and the concepts behind it as it becomes an acoustic building material within the composition by the means of electroacoustic music. The duration of the composition as well as other internal parameters concerning structure and form has been deduced from the ratio of the sides of the room: 1:1.33031. The csound 3rd−order−ambisonic opcodes by Jan Jacob Hofmann were used for multichannel spatialization.

                      <p>Queries and responses are what you always see in your daily life. Questions and answers are issued by people and also by digital equipments. A digitally empowered piano also sometimes issues queries to obtain sonified responses from a computer. The first version of this piece is commissioned by and dedicated to Hiroaki OOI, who studied electronics at Kyoto University with KITA (the composer) some decades ago. It was premiered by OOI (piano) and KITA (smartphone), and this time totally re-coded for a MIDI piano and smartphones.</p>

                      <h4>Michael Rhoads</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div class="toggle-item-body" style="display: none;">
                      <p>“Sidereal Sonata” is a Csound composition intended for 8-channel, 3D spatialization. It is the opening piece from a project titled “Echoes and Reflections”.</p>

                      <p>Of special note was the Cartesian coordinate system utilized to determine the orientation of an event within a cuboid speaker arrangement. In part inspired by John Chowing’s work with his compositions “Sabelithe” and “Turneas” in the early 70’s, I developed a perspective that considers each speaker as an “attractor”, acting as mass in the form of amplitude, thus affecting the perceived path of a sound event as it moves through a 3D diffusion environment. With this paradigm, the greater the amplitude of a speaker, the more mass it exerts and the more powerful the effect of pulling a sound event in its direction as the event moves through the 3D space. The effect is perhaps similar to Einstein’s perspective of gravity wells in space.</p>

                      <p>For this piece, 4 base samples were generated using a Roland Gaia synthesizer. Although this approach perhaps runs contrary to the typical Csound compositional approach, I had been working with this fantastic sounding synth and had developed some very interesting sounds and so used them for this composition.</p>

                      <p>I came across the word Se'nnight in a list of unusual or little-known words, and I liked it; it also seemed appropriate for this, the seventh piece in the Drums and Different Cannons series.  It is also roughly in seven overlapping sections which lead back to the beginning.</p> 

                      <p>The sounds and some of the structure comes from the first of the series, with a heavy dependency on the Henon map and percussion sounds, especially marimba-like.  The sound is distributed around the listener, using two dimensional second-order ambisonics; the music is ideally delivered by as many speakers that can be arranged regularly.</p>

                      <p>There is no story, just the sounds and their patterns.</p>
