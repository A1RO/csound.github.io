User Defined Opcodes (UDOs) are written in the Csound language and can then be used in the code similar to built-in opcodes. There is a growing collection of them, currently at two places:

[www.csounds.com/udo](http://www.csounds.com/udo) is the old repository; simple to use.

[http://github.com/csudo/csudo](http://github.com/csudo/csudo) is a new git-based repository which automatically exports .udo files to be included in Csound code.
