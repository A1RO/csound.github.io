title: What is Csound
---


Csound can most accurately be described as a compiler. What is a compiler? A compiler is a software that takes textual instructions in the form of source code and converts them into object code. This object code then gets converted into some kind of executable binary in the form of a computer program. Csound works in more or less the same way, only its object code is a stream of numbers representing audio. In order for us to hear that audio we must play it back through a Digital to Analogue Converter. The DAC converts each of the sequenced numbers to a voltage that causes our speakers to move and vibrate, thus creating sound.
