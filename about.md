TODO: This page should also describe, what is Csound, how it can be used, describe how to proceed with learning.

Csound is a sound and music computing system which was originally developed by Barry Vercoe in 1985 at MIT Media Lab. Since the 90s, it has been developed by a group of core developers, and a wider community of volunteers which contribute examples, documentation, articles, and takes part of the Csound development with bug reports, feature requests and discussions with the core development team.      

Although Csound has a strong tradition as a tool for composing electro-acoustic pieces, it is used by composers and musicians for any kind of music that can be made with the help of the computer. Csound can also be used in real-time and interactive contexts, on mobile devices or in combination with other programming languages.

One of the main principles in Csound development is to guarantee backwards compatibility. You can still render a Csound source file from 1986 on the latest Csound release, and you should be able to render a file written today with the latest Csound in 2036.
