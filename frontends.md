# Frontends

Csound is a library, which can be accessed through different **frontends**. The classic one is the terminal command *csound*, which is present in all desktop installations of Csound. If you want to use Csound via a Graphic UI, various frontends are available from third-party developers. Among these, the most popular are:

[**CsoundQt**](http://qutecsound.sourceforge.net/) is most probably already included in the Mac and Windows installer. It has nice tools for editing Csound files, comes with easy editable widgets and a huge example collection.

[**Cabbage**](http://cabbageaudio.com/) is originally designed to create VST plugins from Csound instruments, but it can also be used to run and edit Csound files, as well as creating standalone applications.

[**Blue**](http://blue.kunstmusik.com) is an amazingly comprehensive composition tool for working with Csound.

[**WinXound**](http://winxound.codeplex.com) is a simple but solid frontend for Csound, particularly on the Windows platform.

[**RIBCsound**](http://rorywalsh.github.io/RIBCsound) is an online (Chrome only) interface builder for generating Csound enabled web-pages. Csound channels can be set up between widgets and instruments so that end-users can control the Csound instruments in real-time in the browser.
