Csound is an audio library that provides users with an extensive arrays of audio functions. As with most libraries, it can be accessed through so-called **front-ends** that communicate with the core library. The classic front-end is CLI(Command Line Interface) *csound*, which is present in all desktop installations of Csound. If you use the Csound from the command line you can edit your Csound code with any source code editor you like. 

Learning to use Csound from the command line can be a bit daunting for most beginners. Thankfully there exists a number of integrated solutions for using Csound in a more user-friendly graphical environment. Listed below are some of the more popular solutions. Each of these applications are supported, developed and promoted by members of the Csound community.
