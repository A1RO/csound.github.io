		  <dd>
		  Today’s Csound is but the latest link in an uninterrupted chain
		  of development that stretches back 60 years to 1957, when Max
		  Mathews wrote the first digital synthesis program, MUSIC I. The
		  seeds for what we have today were sown in the early sixties with
		  MUSIC III and IV. The basic shape for Csound was put in place
		  later in the decade with MUSIC 360, followed by MUSIC 11 in the
		  seventies. This talk explores the history of this software, with
		  a close look at the main developments leading to the latest
		  version of Csound.</dd>

		  I am using Csound since twenty years, being more active in its
		  community since more than ten years. I will talk about different
		  experiences with this collaborative work in this time, and I will
		  try to reflect some of these aspects in a more general context:
		  What is the situation in which we develop a software like Csound?
		  Why do we do it? What are restrictions, where is our freedom?</dd>

		  <dd>
		  Joachim Heintz studied first literature, than composition with
		  korean composer Younghi Pagh-Paan in Bremen, Germany. Since 2004
		  he is head of the Electronic Studio FMSBW in the Institute for
		  New Music Incontri at Hanover University for Music Drama and
		  Media, responsible for teaching electronic composition. In
		  2016/17 he was also invited as guest professor to ICEM at
		  Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen.  Although in a way
		  specialized in working with electronic media, his compositions
		  are not purely electroacoustic works. He also works for
		  instruments alone, and in particular for instruments with live
		  electronics (e.g. "S‘io non miro non moro" for soprano and
		  electronics 2013, or "Wege" for string quartet and electronics
		  2017). Except for concerts, he also works for installations and
		  performances (theatre and readings).</dd>
		  <dd>
		  Since 2005 he is part of the Open Source Software movement, in
		  particular the well-known audio programming language Csound.  He
		  hosted the first International Csound Conference 2011 in Hanover
		  and founded the Csound FLOSS Manual which is now the standard
		  textbook to learn Csound.  He is one of the authors of the new
		  Csound Book in Springer Publishing.</dd>
		  <dd>
		  He held classes in many countries, recently in Tehran (Iran),
		  Montevideo (Uruguay), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Seoul (Korea).
		  He tries to teach not only programming but to discuss questions
		  of composition and art in general and in the field of electronic
		  music in particular. </dd>

	theoretical background, present state and prospective</p>
      <p class="speaker">Oscar Pablo Di Liscia</p>

	<p><img src="./img/diliscia.jpg"></p>

		  <dt>Abstract</dt>
		  <dd>
		  The ATS technique (Analysis-Transformation-Synthesis) was
		  developed by the composer and researcher Juan Pampin (DXARTS, UW,
		  USA). Essentially, it represents two aspects of the analyzed
		  signal: the deterministic part and the stochastic part. This
		  model was initially conceived by Julius Orion Smith and Xavier
		  Serra, but ATS refines certain aspects of it, such as the
		  inclusion of psycho-acoustic data. The deterministic part
		  consists of sinusoidal trajectories with varying amplitude,
		  frequency and phase. It is obtained performing high-level
		  analysis on the spectral data obtained using Short-Time Fourier
		  Transform analysis. The stochastic part is also termed residual,
		  because it is achieved by subtracting the deterministic signal
		  from the original signal. Since approximately 2001, several
		  applications were developed by a team of academics from UNQ
		  (Argentina) and UW Seattle (USA). These applications included
		  stand alone programs as well as unit generators for environments
		  like Pure Data, SuperCollider and Csound. The talk will address
		  the theoretical background of the ATS technique, the present
		  state of the opcodes and analysis units developed in Csound, and
		  their future improvements.

		  Sound Spatialisation and Spectral Analysis of Digital Sound),
		  Electronic Composition and Computer Music. His compositions, both
		  electronic and instrumental were awarded by national and
		  international societies, recorded and edited, and performed in

		  <dt>Abstract</dt>
		  <dd>
		  In the 1980s and 90s, Csound cut a pioneering path, enabling a
		  wider range of composers and researchers to access the explore
		  computer music techniques established by the Music N family of
		  programs. During these early stages of its existence, Csound sat
		  relatively unchallenged as the serious tool for computer-based
		  sound synthesis. This talk will explore how, within out current
		  burgeoning toolbox of computer music options, Csound has
		  continued to redefine itself, integrate and innovate. The speaker
		  will also describe his own journey with Csound from the late
		  1990s and his ongoing pursuit to exhaust its possibilities.
		  </dd>

		  <dt>Biography</dt>

		  Iain McCurdy is a composer and lecturer originally from Belfast
		  and currently based at Maynooth University Ireland. He has been
		  working with, and contributing to, the Csound project since 1999.
		  His contributions to Csound have included working on the FLOSS
		  manual project, writing parts of the new Springer Csound Book. He
		  has also written a catalogue of over 600 interactive examples for
		  Csound covering many of its capabilities.  This resource has
		  proved valuable for many learning the program. Since 2015 Iain
		  has also taken on the role of co&ndash;editor of the Csound
		  Journal with Jim Hearon. More recent work has focussed on the
		  popular Csound front&ndash;end, Cabbage.

		  <dd>
		  Since January 2016 Iain has held the position of Lecturer in
		  Music at the University of Maynooth (National University of
		  Ireland) where his teaching duties cover composition, electronic
		  music, programming and research supervision.
		  </dd>

		  <dd>
		  As a composer his work has covered the areas of acousmatic,
		  electroacoustic, instrumental, sound installation and
		  cross&ndash;disciplinary works involving all four. His work with
		  sound installations and alternative controller design has drawn
		  in exploration of electronics, sensors and instrument building.

	<p style="margin-top:1em;"><img src="./img/yi.jpg"></p>
	      <dl>
		  <dt>Abstract</dt>
		  <dd>
		  The technology of computers and computer music has changed
		  greatly since I first encountered Csound in 1999. Now, in 2017,
		  31 years after Csound was first released, I find I enjoy using
		  Csound more than ever.  In this talk, I will discuss how and why
		  I use Csound today. I will demonstrate and share ways in which my
		  own personal practice and approach to using Csound has evolved
		  over time. I will then look at ways Csound could evolve and
		  consider how those changes may impact how we see and use Csound
		  in the future.

		  2005–2015, and is co-author of the book Csound. A Sound and Music
		  Computing System, published by Springer International.
